in CSS everything is a concept of box.
Like in the innermost part there stays content.
then Padding surrounds content. Then there is border and
outermost is Margin

 box-sizing: border-box; --> means content+border+padding must be 
 equals to height. Margin isn't included in this.

 
Margin collapse in CSS is when the top and bottom margins 
of adjacent elements combine to form a single margin.
This happens when there's no padding, border,
or content separating them.
The larger margin value between the elements is used, 
causing spacing to appear smaller than expected. 
Understanding this helps in creating consistent layouts.
